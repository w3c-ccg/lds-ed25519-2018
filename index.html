This specification describes a standard signature suite created in 2018 for the
Ed25519 signature scheme using Curve25519, used e.g. by Hyperledger Indy.

This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular revisions. It
is not fit for production deployment.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification describes a standard signature suite created in 2018 for the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. It uses the RDF
Dataset Normalization Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] to transform the
input document into its canonical form. It uses SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] as the
<a>message digest algorithm</a> and Ed25519 [[ED25519]] as the
<a>signature algorithm</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
generation and verification of the Ed25519 2018
<a>signature suite</a>.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of
a canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a signature
algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for developers
for the purposes of safety and convenience.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>canonicalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one possible
representation and always transforms it into a canonical form. This process is
sometimes also called normalization.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>message digest algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces a cryptographic
output message that is often many orders of magnitude smaller than the
input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
non-reversible, 3) cause the output to change significantly when even one
bit of the input message changes, and 4) make it infeasible to find two
different inputs for the same output.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value where the
receiver of the message can mathematically verify that the message has not
been modified in transit and came from someone possessing a particular secret.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>Examples</h2>

      <p>
A simple example of an Ed25519 2018 Signature Verification Key:

}
      </pre>

      <p>Note: The <code>publicKeyBase58</code> property contains the raw public key bytes. The encoding is Base58 using the same alphabet as Bitcoin addresses and IPFS hashes.</p>

      <h2>The Ed25519 2018 Signature Suite</h2>

      <p>
The Ed25519 2018 <a>signature suite</a> MUST be used in
conjunction with the signing and verification algorithms in the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. The suite consists of
the following algorithms:
